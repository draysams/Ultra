Ultra is a visual, cross-platform SSH client that parses your terminal output to improve readability and show documentation on mouseover.

This brower-based demo only parses the bash command top (tested on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS), but it's forked from WebSSH2, so it can SSH into any server. I'm working on a desktop version that parses more command outputs.
